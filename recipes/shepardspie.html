    <h4>Description:</h4>
    This recipe has simple ingredients but tons of flavor with a <strong>creamy ricotta mixture, savory meat sauce, and lots of mozzarella cheese.</strong>
    This is a great freezer meal, make-ahead recipe, and leftovers freeze and reheat super well.

        <li>15 oz. ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>

        <li>2 teaspoons Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Meat sauce</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 yellow onion</li>
        <li>3/4lb ground beef</li>
        <li>3/4lb ground italian sausage</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>40 oz. marinara sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon hot sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Lasagna Noodles / Cheese Topping</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>2.5 cups mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Steps</h5>
    <ol>
        <li> Combine the cheese filling ingredients in a medium bowl and set aside. Measure out remaining ingredients.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil over medium heat and add the diced onions. Let them soften for 10 minutes. (This allows them to release a little sugar which is a nice offset to the acidity of the tomatoes.)</li>
        <li>Add the ground beef and sausage and increase heat to medium-high. Use a spatula to break up the meat so that it’s very fine and crumbled. Cook for 8-10 minutes, or until cooked through. Add garlic during the last minute. Drain excess grease.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken broth and use a silicone spatula to “clean” the bottom and sides of the pot. Add the marinara sauce, tomato paste, hot sauce, and Worcestershire sauce. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cover partially and let the sauce simmer gently while you boil the pasta noodles.Add the chicken broth and use a silicone spatula to “clean” the bottom and sides of the pot.
